# Delaunay-Triangulation
C++ implementation for merge algorithm to compute Delaunay Triangulation, by Guibas and Stolfi

In this package, the code featured includes the geometric primitives for numerical computation, such as Orient2D and Incircle tests, by Jonathan Shewchuk. It also features my implementation of the delaunay triangulation and the quad-edge data structure, from the paper. 

To run, go into the "Code" folder, and run in terminal, "./makefile". This will compile both the C file "predicates.c" and the C++ file "del.cpp" and link them together. 

The testfiles are in the "Test Files" folder. They include files of vertices (e.g. "4.node").
